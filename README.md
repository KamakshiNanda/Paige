# Paige: Turn The Page
Paige: This name signifies a youthful assistant or helper.

Turn the Page: Initiate a transformative change or shift.

In my youth, the idea of initiating this project took root, driven by a desire to assist students in seamlessly buying and selling their books. The primary aim was to foster a community where mutual support thrived, all while eliminating intermediaries who viewed books merely as a means of profit.

I developed a web application by leveraging core Java concepts, specifically servlets and JSP. To enhance the frontend experience, I incorporated AJAX, Bootstrap, and JavaScript capabilities, contributing to a smoother user interface.
